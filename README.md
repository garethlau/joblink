# Weekly Project Challenge
I've challenged myself to build something every week. My motivation for doing this challenge is to a) explore crazy ideas that I might otherwise put off b) explore different technologies that I don't normally use c) better understand my learning pace and d) give myself something to do while I'm at home all day.

Along the way, I plan to collaborate with friends as it just makes everything a bit funner :)

I might continue to work on some of these projects after the week but I'll tag the last commit included in the timeline of the challenge with wpc (weekly project challenge).

# Project #2 - Joblink
Joblink is a Chrome extension and web app that users can use to track job applications. 

## TODO's if I had more time
- Fitler tracked jobs
- Graphs and charts to visualize data
- Use Chrome API's to get and parse the company name from the URL

## Demo
